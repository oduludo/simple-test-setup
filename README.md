# simple-test-setup
This app's goal is to write some simple unit tests. It's not so much about the tests or coverage, but to get them to work with vue-test-utils and Jest.

#### Test ideas
* Test the user interaction in the `Student` component. Clicking the year + and - buttons should change the value of `student.year`.
